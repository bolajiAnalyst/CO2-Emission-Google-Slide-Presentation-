<h4>CO2 Emissions Project Overview</h4>

This project visualizes **CO₂ emissions of countries across continents from 1960 to 2010 using Google Slides, Tableau, and Spreadsheets**. The goal is to identify long-term emission trends, compare regional patterns, and highlight key shifts in global carbon output over five decades.

**Tools & Workflow**
**Spreadsheets**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and organization of CO₂ emission datasets.

**Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and time-series visualizations to reveal patterns across continents and countries.

**Google Slides**: Structured presentation of findings, insights, and visual narratives for effective communication.

**Key Features**
Historical CO₂ emission trends (1960–2010).

Regional comparisons across continents.

Identification of growth drivers and emission plateaus.

Clear, visual storytelling for sustainability discussions.

Purpose

This project supports climate change awareness, sustainability research, and policy analysis by providing a data-driven perspective on how emissions have evolved globally.
